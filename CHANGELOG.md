## [5.1.5] - 2026-11-12

Updates never actually arrived. They do now.
- The app downloaded a new version and then stopped dead. It was telling the updater to swap the files over in a way that shuts the whole page down mid-sentence, so the step that announces the update never ran - which is why no update has ever appeared, on any version.
- The About page now says what the last check did: up to date, could not reach the server, the download did not finish. A phone has no error log, so a check that failed quietly looked exactly like one with nothing to do.

## [5.1.4] - 2026-11-12

A new version now asks to be installed, instead of hoping you noticed.
- An update shows a sheet you have to answer, with the version and what changed in it. Before this it was a notice that slid away after a few seconds, so anyone in the middle of booking in a phone simply missed it - and a new APK was never announced at all, because the check for one had never been wired up.
- Nothing updates behind your back. A web update applies when you tap Update now, because it reloads the screens and would lose anything half-typed. An APK update opens the download in your browser, where you confirm the install.
- The About page shows the version you are actually running. It had said v5.0.0 since v5.0.0, whatever was installed - and because of that, the "App updated!" notice had not appeared for five releases.

## [5.1.3] - 2026-11-12

Android was warning people the app might be harmful. It no longer installs its own updates, which is what set that off.
- "Harmful app blocked" on install. The app asked for permission to install other apps, so it could update itself, and Android blocks that on an app downloaded outside the Play Store from a publisher it has not seen before. That permission is gone.
- Updates still reach you. When a new version is out you get a notification; tapping it opens the download in your browser, which shows the progress and then asks you to install it, the same as any other download.
- A new version was never actually announced before this - the check existed but nothing ran it.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-11-12

Fixes a 5.1.1 bug that trapped the app on the "Alarms and reminders" screen.
- Opening the app sent you straight to that system screen, and coming back sent you there again, with the toggle greyed out so there was nothing you could do about it. 5.1.1 told Android the reminders did not need an exact alarm, but put that setting in the wrong place, so Android never saw it and kept asking for a permission the app no longer has.
- Reminders behave as 5.1.1 intended: no system screen, and a reminder lands in a window around the time you set.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-11-12

Reminders now actually arrive, and the app can update itself.
- Android was silently blocking every reminder. The app never asked permission to notify you, so reminders and the daily summary were scheduled and then dropped without a word. It now asks once, when you sign in, and tells you where to switch them on if you say no.
- No second "Alarms and reminders" screen on the way in. A reminder set for 4pm may arrive a few minutes either side rather than on the minute, which is the right trade for a phone waiting to be collected.
- New versions can arrive without reinstalling. The app checks for an update, downloads it, and applies it the next time you open it - never in the middle of booking in a phone - with a note saying what changed. A broken update undoes itself.
- Smaller: the install is about half the size, and an update downloads 1.4MB instead of 7MB. Four other apps were shipping inside this one with no way to open them.

# CREATED CASHBOOK APP [2025-11-8]
